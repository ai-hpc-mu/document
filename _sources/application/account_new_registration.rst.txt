Currently, the account application system is being replaced to enhance security.

This document refers to the old account system.

Account registrations are being accepted continuously. (However, registrations for large-scale users are temporarily suspended.) Until the new account application system is operational, please contact us by email for further information.

The current procedure for applying for an account is as follows:

Apply for an account by emailing the help desk.
An account registration certificate will be sent by post.
Create your SSH public and private keys.
Transfer the SSH public key to the NIG supercomputer using the ssh-copy-id command.
SSH login will be enabled.
