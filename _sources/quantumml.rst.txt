Quantum Machine Learning
=========================

Tensor networks or tensor network states are a class of variational wave functions used in the study of many-body quantum systems.[1] Tensor networks extend one-dimensional matrix product states to higher dimensions while preserving some of their useful mathematical properties.[Wiki]

Developer familly with Machine Learning framework such as tensorflow and Pytorchcan be prepared to simulate quantum algorithms on GPU High Performance Computing. At time of this draft, there are two classes of simulator method that are state vector simulator and Tensor 

Quantum-classical hybrid paradigm and variational quantum algorithms

Tensor network for quantum wave
WorkFlow for HPC QC AI/ML 
=========================

The following guides are intend to introduce basic tools for Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run workloads on limited or expensive computing resources including HPC clusters, GPU arrays, quantum computers and cloud services..

Covalent
---------------------
Covalent is a powerful open-source orchestration platform designed to harmonize the dynamic and complex world of advanced computing. It streamlines the utilization and management of disparate computational resources, encompassing classical high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and AI/ML paradigms. Covalent is a workflow management tool, designed for the orchestration of, and seamless communication between these distinct systems, empowering teams to focus on higher-value R&D objectives.

`Covalent is ideal for scaling jobs from your laptop / Jupyter notebook to any heterogenous combination of hardware backends <https://docs.covalent.xyz>`_ 

Quantum computing with Dask Parallel: 
---------------------------------------
We are rework on Quantum Algorithms for  Time Series Anomaly Detection to verify workflow is work on HPC cluster and Dask. Then next PennyLane Lighting.gpu.

Let solve notebook issue change 'requirement.txt' for notebook to version 6.5.6
