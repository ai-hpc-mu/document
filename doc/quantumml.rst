WorkFlow for HPC QC AI/ML 
=========================

The following guides are intend to introduce basic tools for Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run workloads on limited or expensive computing resources including HPC clusters, GPU arrays, quantum computers and cloud services..

Covalent
---------------------
Covalent is a powerful open-source orchestration platform designed to harmonize the dynamic and complex world of advanced computing. It streamlines the utilization and management of disparate computational resources, encompassing classical high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and AI/ML paradigms. Covalent is a workflow management tool, designed for the orchestration of, and seamless communication between these distinct systems, empowering teams to focus on higher-value R&D objectives.

`Covalent is ideal for scaling jobs from your laptop / Jupyter notebook to any heterogenous combination of hardware backends <https://docs.covalent.xyz>`_ 

Quantum computing with Dask Parallell: 
---------------------------------------
We are rework on Quantum Algorithms for  Time Series Anomaly Detection to verify workflow is work on HPC cluster and Dask. Then next PennyLane Lighting.gpu.

Let solve notebook issue change 'requirement.txt' for notebook to version 6.5.6
