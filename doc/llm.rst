Large Language Model 
=========================

Qurge language model (LLM) is a language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language generation. LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs are artificial neural networks typically built with a transformer-based architecture. Some recent implementations are based on alternative architectures such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).

LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.[5] Up to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results.[6] They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and "ontology" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.

LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), released by Meta AI starting in February 2023.


WorkFlow for HPC QC AI/ML 
=========================

The following guides are intend to introduce basic tools for Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run workloads on limited or expensive computing resources including HPC clusters, GPU arrays, quantum computers and cloud services..

Covalent
---------------------
Covalent is a powerful open-source orchestration platform designed to harmonize the dynamic and complex world of advanced computing. It streamlines the utilization and management of disparate computational resources, encompassing classical high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and AI/ML paradigms. Covalent is a workflow management tool, designed for the orchestration of, and seamless communication between these distinct systems, empowering teams to focus on higher-value R&D objectives.

`Covalent is ideal for scaling jobs from your laptop / Jupyter notebook to any heterogenous combination of hardware backends <https://docs.covalent.xyz>`_ 

Quantum computing with Dask Parallel: 
---------------------------------------
We are rework on Quantum Algorithms for  Time Series Anomaly Detection to verify workflow is work on HPC cluster and Dask. Then next PennyLane Lighting.gpu.

Let solve notebook issue change 'requirement.txt' for notebook to version 6.5.6
